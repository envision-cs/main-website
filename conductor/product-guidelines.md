# Product Guidelines

These guidelines define the standards for content, design, and user experience for the Envision Construction Services website.

## Content & Prose Style

- **Direct & Concise:** Content should be punchy and professional. Avoid fluff; focus on delivering value-driven information clearly.
- **Values-Informed Tone:** While professional, the tone should reflect integrity and commitment. Use language that suggests reliability and service without being overly preachy.

## Visual & UX Design

- **Modern Minimalist:** Prioritize clean layouts, high-quality professional photography, and ample white space. The UI should feel sophisticated and high-end.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Use imagery to showcase not just the buildings, but the people and the community impact. Focus on collaboration and excellence.
- **High Performance:** The user experience must be fast and responsive across all devices (mobile-first approach).

## Accessibility & Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** Ensure all users can navigate the site. This includes proper semantic HTML, accessible color contrast, and keyboard navigability.
- **Nuxt-First Patterns:** Leverage Nuxt's built-in features for performance (e.g., Nuxt Image, optimized routing) to ensure the best possible technical execution.

## Key Performance Indicators (UX)

- **Speed:** Aim for high Lighthouse scores, particularly for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Input Delay (FID).
- **Inquiry Efficiency:** The contact form should be easy to use, with minimal required fields to maximize conversion for lead generation.
