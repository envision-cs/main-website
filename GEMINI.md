## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Installation

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting, with a configuration based on `@antfu/eslint-config`. It is recommended to use an editor with ESLint integration to ensure code quality and consistency.

To run the linter:

```bash
bun lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues:

```bash
bun lint:fix
```

### Git Hooks

The project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run `lint-staged` before each commit. This ensures that all staged files are properly linted before they are committed to the repository.

### Content Management

The website's content is managed using Nuxt Content. The content is written in Markdown and is located in the `content/` directory. The schema for the content is defined in `content.config.ts` using `zod` for validation.

### API

The project has a server-side API endpoint to fetch all projects from the `content/projects/` directory. The API endpoint is located at `server/api/projects/index.get.ts`.
