For the projects that still matter, but don’t need the full machine.

Not every project needs full preconstruction, deep coordination, or a lengthy timeline. Designed for jobs with a contract value of $1,000 to $100,000, our Specialty Projects Division (SPD) provides a variety of work by undertaking high-volume, simple maintenance jobs.

As a specialized arm of Envision built for agility, clarity, and fast execution, SPD operates at the pace of your needs without ever compromising craftsmanship or care. We don’t believe in rushing. We believe in executing with intention: quickly, cleanly, and confidently.

Quick-turn. High-impact. Zero-compromise. That’s our SPD promise to you.
