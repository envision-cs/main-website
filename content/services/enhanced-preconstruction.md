### Preconstruction Approach

Great projects begin with excellence in preconstruction. Envision holds extreme value in the feasibility and preconstruction process, as this is what ultimately leads to a successful, timely, and cost-effective project. Meeting our client’s budget and proposed timeline is our top priority. We believe that constant effective communication and collaboration is the key to success. Our preconstruction process has created an atmosphere where open, effective communication is our culture, allowing our cost-control methods to be exceptional.

### Our Services

Model based and real time estimating
We are passionate about model-based estimating, using the design team’s building information model (BIM) weekly to get real-time quantities and design direction. This approach allows us to proactively manage the project budget in the design and preconstruction phases by utilizing “real-time estimating” feedback and input without compromising the project or important design
Elements.

### 3D Quantity Surveying & Trending Analysis

Envision’s preconstruction model utilizes the architect’s REVIT Model to capture 3D modeling surveying and identifies the project scope in greater detail prior to obtaining a formal deliverable. We use Assemble software to quantify and trend quantities throughout the preconstruction and construction phases. Assemble allows us to produce real time construction progress. We use this feature to enhance our schedule of values and payment to our subcontractors.

### Our Trade Partners

We treat our trade partners with the utmost respect, viewing them as trusted partners. Envision has built a strong trade partner database in the Tampa Bay Area who we can count on to partner with us to provide reliable cost estimates throughout the preconstruction process. Having a strong trade partner database ensures our client gets the most competitive pricing we
can offer.

### Target Value Design

Envision looks to maximize the design of every project within the given budget and provide the best value to our clients. To do this, we utilize the target value design approach. In this approach, we provide our support to design to a budget, rather than the conventional process of estimating a design then re-designing if there are budget overruns. Target value design is an effective approach to maximizing the program requirements of a building and adding value.

### Supply Chain Management

Instead of solely focusing on estimating drawing deliverables, Envision’s approach to preconstruction takes into consideration supply chain management and early enhanced project scheduling utilizing the supply chain study. Leveraging our relationships with our trade partners and their suppliers, we are able to study and identify heavy lead times and any material or labor increases organized per bid package, developing a supply chain management report. These studies allow us to remain in the know of the constantly evolving market we are facing within the construction industry.

### Enhanced Project Schedule

Going above and beyond in our due diligence period allows us to find creative ways with the use of technology to identify issues early on that can help alleviate potential surprises down the line as it relates to the schedule and budget. Our preconstruction, project management, and field operations teams work in tandem during the creation of the project schedule, identifying critical path and key activity durations and milestones while working with our trade partners to discover long lead time items.
