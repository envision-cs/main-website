title: It's Bigger Than You
---

“Your gifts, talents, and resources aren’t only for you or about you. Without believing in something bigger than yourself, you’ll only seek to serve yourself.”

- Always seek to give the advantage
- Do it as if it were your own
- Great leaders have a servant’s heart
