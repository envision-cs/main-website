Notes:
I served as Executive Project Manager at Revealing Truth Ministries and within our Outreach and Global Missions arm for 7 years. Within my everyday tasks I was blessed with the opportunity to serve as an assistant to our Senior Pastor Bryan Powe overseeing operations domestically and internationally. Implementing new initiatives, speaking with the heart of the Ministry and fostering lasting relationships were apart of the joy day to day operations amongst my 7 year tenured. Prayer and prior experience combined will allow me to execute my job role while being excited knowing, "There’s a new beginning at every level."
