Envision completed interior renovations for Celestar at their Tampa Headquarters. In addition to constructing a new entryway, the existing conference room and gym areas were doubled to create four new office spaces. Our team performed selective demolition, new finish carpentry and millwork, new doors, frames and hardware, drywall, framing, acoustical, paint, new ACT, electrical, HVAC, new flooring, and signage on this 922 SF office. This project was completed during normal business hours, where our team kept all noise and dust to a complete minimum to ensure no disruption to the staff during construction.
