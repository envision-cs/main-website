The Revealing Truth Ministries Interior Upgrades project transformed the 30,000 SF worship center into a state-of-the-art facility. Visitors are met with a beautiful foyer upon entry, where existing circular columns were framed with drywall as a cost-effective yet modern upgrade. The main worship area, library, café, offices, and restrooms were renovated through selective demolition and implementation of new electrical systems, 2x2 LED lighting, new ceilings, room dividers, carpet tile, and a glass storefront. Additionally, buildout of backstage areas created new meeting spaces for church attendees.

Our team worked closely with the owner to strategize different ways to keep costs low while implementing functional improvements to fit the growing needs of the ministry. Envision assisted with the design and aesthetic goals for this interior renovation project, providing creative yet cost-effective methods and ideas to reach the desired end product.
