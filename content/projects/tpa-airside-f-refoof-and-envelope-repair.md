Envision and The Beck Group provided preconstruction, architecture, construction, and VBG for this project. Our team evaluated and replaced the original barrel vault standing seam roof, gutters, and storm drainage systems. In addition, extensive rehabilitation of glazing systems and other miscellaneous envelope conditions were added during evaluation and design phases. The repair and replacement of these systems is essential to maintain top HCAA in extending the operational life of the Airside F building for another 25 years.

In collaboration with our CM partner, The Beck Group, Envision provided comprehensive support across all phases of the project to include executive oversight, project management, field supervision, preconstruction services, and client engagement. Our integrated role ensured alignment, continuity, and excellence from pursuit to delivery.
