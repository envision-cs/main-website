The Moffitt Cancer Center New CT Scan was a two-phase design-build project to build a new CT Suite on the 3rd level of the Magnolia Clinic Building (MCB), driven by a new Siemens Somatom Definition Edge CT Scanner. Phase 1 required the relocation of the current imaging Administration Office suite, while Phase 2 accommodated a new CT machine to serve the need for additional radiology at the hospital. The Beck-Envision team executed the work under budget while the hospital remained operational.
