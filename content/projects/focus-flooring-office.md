With the goal of creating more workspaces with 1,500 SF of space, the Focus Flooring Office Build-Out doubled capacity from 10 employees to 20. The office was built out and renovated to include a new kitchenette area, one large workspace, two new offices with adjoining cubicle work spaces, and a conference room. New finishes were implemented as well, including new flooring and base throughout, metal framing and drywall, doors and hardware, paint, ACT, light fixtures, and signage.
