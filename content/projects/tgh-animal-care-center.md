The TGH Animal Care Center at The Florida Aquarium is a testament to the value of a partnership between organizations dedicated to providing life-saving treatment. In addition to enhancing the treatment environment for 9,000 creatures, the 500 SF buildout also granted aquarium guests a behind-the-scenes view of animal examinations. However, the glass windows that provide this view were not installed at the expense of privacy; their appearance can be switched to frosted when more serious treatments must be performed.

Upon wall demolition, the buildout resulted in a raised floor with a trench drain, a new ceiling and cabinet, new storefront framing, countertops, and LED lighting.
