Envision and The Beck Group collaborated to renovate the Physicians Lounge at Tampa General Hospital, providing a new conservatory with a glass roof, workspaces in soundproof rooms, a coffee lounge, and new seating. The $1.7 million project was approved by the American Health Care Association three weeks ahead of schedule. Many of the design elements—such as the interior glass doors, natural walnut conference table with live edges, and oak floors—were custom made for the lounge.
