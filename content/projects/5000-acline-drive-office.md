The 5000 Acline Drive Office Build Out was designed with many factors in mind, including potential for future growth, the flow of the office, aesthetic of the interior space, and provision of a welcoming feel. Built from shell space, the project resulted in seven offices, a “cubicle” work area with three work spaces, one large conference room, one small conference room, two restrooms, and a break room with a kitchenette at a total of 4,500 SF.
